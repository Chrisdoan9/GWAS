**Scree plot / elbow plot**: how much information (variance) each principal component (PC) captures from your data.  
Eigenvalue = amount of variation explained by a component

Σ is the covariance matrix:  
	Σ × v = λ × v  
	•	v = eigenvector (PC direction)  
	•	λ = eigenvalue (variance explained by that direction)
